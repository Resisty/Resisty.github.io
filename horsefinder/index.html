We also have a fascination with horses. Our horsefinder bot scours Twitter for
mentions of horses and relays them to us. As a panic of sysadmins, we have
standards to which our bots should adhere, however and when we noticed that the
string "horse" quite often appears co-incidentally with a number of undesirable
word, we developed a filtering strategy. We group those undesirable  words into
several categories and filter tweets accordingly. Our results are fourfold:
first, we discover the undesirable categories which most often mention horses.
Second, we examine the frequency with which words in each category result in a
block. Third, we examine additional words beyond the categorical ban marker and
"horse" that are coincident in the blocked tweet. Finally, we examine the
desirable horse-related content from our bot.
