<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I am the ideal candidate for the position of Software/Systems Engineer - Site Reliability at Squarespace as this letter and my CV will indicate. In my time as a Platform Operations Engineer I have grown my skills not only as a systems administrator but also as a software engineer, taking on and maintaining multiple full-stack Python applications with the goal of automating workflows and saving time. I have also worked on a Golang microservice to allow role-based access to an instance of Netflix's Lemur project.</p>
<p>I have worked as some variation of Systems Administrator for over six years now, beginning as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota. Over the last two years I have undertaken a large amount of automation effort, writing various Python and Golang applications. I have implemented the backend, making database and system calls; the server, writing RESTful APIs; and the frontend, writing jQuery which consumes the aforementioned APIs. Additionally, I am still growing my skills as a sysadmin as I am the senior engineer in charge of implementing monitoring solutions at Jive Software which currently includes the Datadog agent and kubernetes integrations. Furthermore, I have worked extensively with both Terraform and Ansible in order to implement stateful deployments to CoreOS instances in both private datacenters and in AWS across multiple regions and availability zones.</p>
<p>My focus on automation, maintainable and scalable code, and proactive monitoring solutions mean that I am prepared to face the challenges Squarespace will provide me. I also know that my experience on both sides of the DevOps coin gives me invaluable experience in solving modern software and technology problems.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to review my attached resume. I am confident you will agree that I have the qualifacations for which you are looking and I look forward to speaking with you soon to set up an interview.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Brian Auron</p>
