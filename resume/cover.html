<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I am the ideal candidate for the position of Sr. Web Based Software Engineer at Disney ABC Television Group as this letter and my CV will indicate. In my time as a Linux Systems Administrator I have demonstrated my skills in deploying and automating Linux systems, both bare-metal and virtualized. I have also grown my skills as a software engineer, taking on and maintaining multiple full-stacks Python applications with the goal of automating workflows and saving time. My easygoing attitude and inquisitive nature allow me to interact with coworkers in an engaging, friendly way.</p>
<p>I have worked as some variation of Systems Administrator for over six years now, beginning as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota. Over the last year and a half I have started the transition to a software engineer, writing a Python application from the backend, making database and system calls, to the server, writing RESTful APIs, to the frontend, writing jQuery which consumes the aforementioned APIs. Additionally, I am still growing my skills as a sysadmin as I am the senior engineer in charge of implementing monitoring solutions at Jive Software which currently includes both the Zenoss monitoring platform and New Relic server and application monitoring. My focus on automation, maintainable and scalable code, and proactive monitoring solutions mean that I am prepared to face the challenges Disney ABC Television Group will provide me.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to review my attached resume. I am confident you will agree that I have the qualifacations for which you are looking and I look forward to speaking with you soon to set up an interview.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Brian Auron</p>
