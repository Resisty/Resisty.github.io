To whom it may concern:

I am the ideal candidate for the position of Senior DevOps Engineer at
REPLACE_ME as this letter and my CV will indicate.  In my time as a
Linux Systems Administrator I have demonstrated my skills in deploying and
automating Linux systems, both bare-metal and virtualized. I have also grown my
skills as a software engineer, taking on and maintaining multiple full-stack
Python applications with the goal of automating workflows and saving time.  My
easygoing attitude and inquisitive nature allow me to interact with coworkers
in an engaging, friendly way.

I have worked as some variation of Systems Administrator for over six years
now, beginning as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota. Over the
last year and a half I have started the transition to a software engineer,
writing a Python application. I have implemented the backend, making database
and system calls; the server, writing RESTful APIs; and the frontend, writing
jQuery which consumes the aforementioned APIs. Additionally, I am still growing
my skills as a sysadmin as I am the senior engineer in charge of implementing
monitoring solutions at Jive Software which currently includes both the Zenoss
monitoring platform and New Relic server and application monitoring. My focus
on automation, maintainable and scalable code, and proactive monitoring
solutions mean that I am prepared to face the challenges REPLACE_ME
will provide me.

Please take a moment to review my attached resume. I am confident you will
agree that I have the qualifacations for which you are looking and I look
forward to speaking with you soon to set up an interview.

Sincerely,

Brian Auron
